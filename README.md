# Smart-Troop-Monitoring-System
This is a project which I submitted for the final semester of my engineering. 
This includes IoT platform BLYNK application for the final analytics of all the data coming from the individual NodeMCU E12.
The server file is the code for the server NodeMCU which first receives data from the station NodeMCU and then send both NodeMCU's data over to Blynk app.
The station file is the code for the station NodeMCU which sends data to the server NodeMCU over Wi-Fi through HTTP protocol.

Sensors interfaced with each NodeMCU: Pulse Sensor and DS18B20 temperature Sensor.

Thank you.
